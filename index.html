  <p>“Full disclosure: I am a geek. I love computers. I love everything about them. I spend eight to ten hours a day in front of a computer screen as I am coding, debugging, or discussing coding practices and methods with other programmers. When I am
    not programming, s as part of my academic work. I truly get excited when a new Web application that does something never done before becomes available for beta testing. I am deeply impressed when I see smart and beautiful code that does something
    I know is hard to accomplish. These are moments when I feel that we have only touched the surface of what we can do with computers, and I know that there is a simple solution to the current programming problem I am facing; I just need to get my
    head around it. With my spare time, I play around with my operating system, trying out new ideas or writing a patch or a bug report to some open source application I use. Most of my day has something to do with computers, until, of course, there
    is cricket match of india. And i am a big fan of virat kohli .
    <br> During my school time I was a very good alrounder my friends were daring to face my ball and I was a hard hitter like Hardik Pandya.</br>
